It can feel daunting in this developer / designer landscape to keep yourself up-to-date with the latest and greatest technologies available. Which new framework should I invest the most time into? Will it even be maintained a couple years down the road? Is it just a fad?

What about programming languages? Should I learn as many as possible or should I become an expert in one specialized area? *Should designers code?<span class="sidenote-number"></span>* The list of possible *new* things you could be learning continues to grow.
<span class="sidenote">This is sarcasm. Please don't take this seriously...</span>

## Jumping right in

Want my advice? Pick something and dive head first into it. Don't worry if it's not the most popular programming language or if it's a new design system that isn't gaining much traction. Do you find it interesting? Awesome - that's what matters most. How can you teach yourself something new when you have *zero* interest in it?

## Less talk, more action

So what am I currently doing to keep my mind fresh and thinking outside of my comfort zone?

- Teaching myself the R programming language
- Deep diving into the `ggplot2` package
- Developing my first side project website using `blogdown` and Hugo
- Trying out Figma as my exclusive design program for the next few months

    <span class="marginnote">Programming your brain to learn something new can be frustrating and pull you out of your comfort zone. Don't let this become stressful - instead use it as inspiration to push yourself through the struggle.</span>

There is no real reason to avoid learning something new outside your current circle of knowledge - only crappy excuses.

Get on it.
